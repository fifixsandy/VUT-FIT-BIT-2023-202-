# INC project

## Description
Project for INC course on VUT FIT. Project is based on UART technologies, circuit receives data words on asynchronous serial line, deserializes and 8bit word writes on out signal with out valid signal in logical 1. uart_rx.vhd includes the circuit in VHDL and uart_rx_fsm.vhd includes implementation of finite state machine. zprava.pdf includes RTL scheme, FSM scheme, screenshot of simulation from GTKWAVE and their description.
