# IVS 2. Project

Second project from IVS course can be found in this repository: https://github.com/fifixsandy/Proj2-NGLYD
## Comment
These are some mistakes we had, be wary of them:

- buttons C, CE, backspace all have different meanings and all should be implemented
- mockup of next version - you should have at least 3 images containing ALL that is in the task (mainly science version)
- tests - make sure to test the largest number of factorial you have implemented
- installer should download all dependencies (if they are stated in the user guide even with a tutorial on how to get them, it is not enough)
- makefile pack - it should also delete already existing zip and then create new one (one more line in makefile)

Some things that were stated that were great:
- profiling and profiling report
- plan
- commit messages (except for one which was a joke)
- usage of GitHub projects
