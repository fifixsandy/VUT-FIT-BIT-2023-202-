# ITY Projects

## Description
Projects for ITY course on VUT FIT. Mainly focused on LaTeX, bibliographic citations and typography. Each of the folders (proj1-proj5) includes necessary files for compilation. I added some PDFs as well to the projects that did not have
exact template.


| PROJECT | POINTS | COMMENT               |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|
| Proj1| 10/10     | No problems    |
| Proj2| 15/15     | No problems  |
| Proj3| 14/15  | chybi \ref, jinak odkazy (I guess...)|
| Proj4| 12/15     | piste oznaceni online a data citaci jen pro zdroje, ktere jsou primarne online (Oops) |
| Proj5| 13/15     | overfull + underfull (caused by FIT template, not really my fault but I had enough points by this time so I did not really care)           |
