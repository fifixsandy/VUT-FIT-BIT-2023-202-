# IFJ project - Compiler of a subset of ZIG (IFJ24)
Implementation of the project can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/fifixsandy/NGLYD-IFJ24-Compiler) with additional information about final score as well as documentation.
## Parts implemented by me:
- recursive 'top-down' parser based on LL1 grammar
- tables of symbols implemented as a AVL-tree
- semantic checks (apart from expressions)
- implementation of Abstract Syntax Tree and its generating during parsing
